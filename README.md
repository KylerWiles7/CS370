I was given code that handles the games functions for the treasure hunting game. I was assigned the task of desigining the AI to learn from its time playing the game to improve later runs. This program will run multiple episodes and store those episodes and outcomes to help future runs. This matters a lot for computer scientists because AI is going to become a big part of our future. I think that I approach problems by looking at the root cause and what could be a good solution to the problem. My ethical responsibilities as a computer scientist entails good security and privacy for the user.
